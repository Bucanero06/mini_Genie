# mini_Genie

An efficient ab-initio method of simulating the financial markets on billions of parameter combinations

Preparation Steps:

    1. Make sure you've got Python & pip
        Before  you  go  any  further, make sure you have Python and that it's available from your
        command line. You can check this by simply running:
        
        $ python --version
        
        You should get some output like 3.9.7. If you do  not  have  Python,  please  install  the
        latest  3.x  version  from  python.org  or  refer  to the Installing Python section of The
        Hitchhiker's Guide to Python. (or use apt isntall)

    1. Make sure python3 (3.9 recommended) and all development tools instaled
    2. Install and update pip
    3. Pip install pipenv *(--upgrade)

Installation Steps:

	3. Clone git repository
	4. $cd mini_genie
	5. $./mini_genie_source/main_mini_genie.py -setup
	5. $pipenv run (*python3.9) mini_genie_source/main_mini_genie.py
	6. Done, this is your executable.
